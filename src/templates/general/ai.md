## DO:
- Make minimal, focused changes
- Use short, direct explanations
- Keep code examples brief and essential only
- Remove unnecessary detail
- Focus on core requirements only

## DO NOT:
- Add extensive code examples
- Provide long explanations
- Include verbose documentation
- Add unnecessary context
- Make comprehensive overhauls when simple updates suffice

**Remember: Following explicit verbosity constraints is more important than being thorough.**
